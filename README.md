SEM Image Sequence Brightness and Contrast Alignment

Sometimes when you take a series of SEM images during a single process, you may find variations in the brightness and contrast settings for imaging cause extra difficulties for analysis. This code helps to align the brightness and contrast of your image sequence, by adjusting the pixel grayscale values of the images.
After the alignment, it should be easy to see how the contrast of your sample changes along the process.
